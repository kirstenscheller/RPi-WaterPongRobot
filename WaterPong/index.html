                        everyone. This robot can be used as a partner when there are not enough people, or as assistance to people who
                        can not aim or throw by themselves. The robot detects cups and aims the catapult entirely autonomously. All the
                        user must do is load and release the catapult.</p>

                        then controls the Parallax standard servo motor. The full system includes the cup stand, the launching mechanism itself, and
                        the software, which includes the aiming system, reracks, and other gameplay. The entire game is controlled through a Raspberry Pi
                        and the gameplay is displayed on a PiTFT. Each of the parts below was tested individually before full system integration, but end-to-end testing of the entire gameplay
                       was our main source of testing. </p>

                        <p class=" mb-4">The cup consists of spots for 6 cups, labeled 1 through 6. Under each cup, there is an IR sensor connected to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi.
                        The sensors have been calibrated to have a range of around 3-4cm and send an input to the Raspberry Pi everytime they detect a cup. When a sensor detects that there is a
                        cup, the spot shows up red on the PiTFT screen, when the cup is not sensed anymore, the spot renders green. When all 6 sensors do not sense a cup simultaneously, the screen changes to a "You Win" screen.
                        </p>
                        <p>When testing the cup detection capabilities, we used the potentiometer on the IR sensor to calibrate its detection distance. Turning the potentiometer changed
                        how far away the object could be before the sensor saw it. Becuase we were using digital signals only, we needed to closely calibrate this threshold value to
                        where the cups would be placed relative to the sensor. The sensors had a range of a couple centimeters, which was more of a concern for the 4-pin sensors, which laid
                        flat on the breadboard. These sometimes had trouble sensing the cups. In order to fix this we added an inch-long "foot" to the bottom of some cups which just brought
                        a detectable surface closer to the sensor for the ones that were more finicky.</colgroup>  </p>

                            of three directions, as shown above, depending on which cup it is aiming for. The robot will only aim for cups that remain on the table, and the PiTFT will state which cup
                            the robot is aiming for. The robot will aim for cups in ascending order starting from cup 1. The servo will aim the catapult in the proper direction at the start of each turn,
                            so all the user must do is wind the catapult and release the ball.
                             </colgroup>  </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class=" mb-4"> There were several ideas on how to aim the catapult, the first being using a servo to tilt the entire catapult platform up and down with a second servo shifting it left
                            and right. The second idea was to use an entire system of gears, pinions, and servos to be able to move the entire catapult platform in both x and y directions. Both of these ideas
                            were eventually proven to not work as the margin of error for the catapult's depth was roughly the same distance as how far the cups were sitting vertically, meaning that with this particular launching mechanism,
                            it was not possible or worth it to spend time adjusting the aim forwards and backwards. Because of this, the aiming algorithm
                            focuses solely on aiming in the left and right direction instead of the forward and backwards position.

                        to a win screen. When a user wants to rerack, they press the rerack button in the corner. The screen then renders a "Rerack screen" that consists of one giant Green button in the center that says done.

                            and utilize PiTFT touchscreen buttons, which increased the visual appeal of the system and makes it much more understandable for the layperson. We had people test the robot
                            who were able to follow along with the game despite knowing nothing about how the IR sensors, servo, and logic actually worked. Through all periods, the robot was very successful.

                            <hr class="divider my-4" />
                            <p class=" mb-4">This project brought together many of the things we had learned in the semester. We were able to use GPIO signals to work with sensors
                            and actuators to create a robot with advanced capabilites. We were easily able to translate our experience with continuous rotation servos and external push buttons
                            into writing code to work with the IR sensors and new servo. This allowed us to reliably detect cups and adjust a standard servo accordingly. We also were able to
                            develop a single application which was able to run an entire game of water pong, with capabilities such as cup aiming and re-racks. The display was shown
                            on the PiTFT screen throughout, which required knowledge of PyGame and other screen rendering techniques. Lastly, we used both physical push buttons and
                            touchscreen buttons on the PiTFT, therefore bringing together the different methods of accepting user input that we had learned this semester.</p>
                            <p class=" mb-4">Improvements to the robot could focus on imprvoing the hardware of the system. For example, we used cardboard and tape to secure many of the parts.
                            This required lots of adjusting as we tested, especially with the catapult. Given the time and resources, we would improve the catapult stage to be more secure and
                            better attached to the servo with screws. Given a larger playing surface and more cups, it would be beneficial to explore the use of another servo, perhaps attached
                            to a rack-and-pinion, to move the catapult closer or further from the cups. Given the circumstances here, we did not need to adjust the catapult beyond its shooting angle,
                            but this would be a valuable future addition to allow the robot to play larger, more advanced, games. Additionally, we could explore using another automated actuator to wind the catapult, which would further reduce need for human input.
                            On the software side, further work could focus on allowing users to select which cup to aim at and override the default aiming of the robot. This would increase user
                            agency while preserving the robot's ability to aim autnonomously. We would also include software to detect cheating during times like re-racking. Right now we rely
                            on trust to prevent the opponent from removign extra cups when they have entered the rerack screen. Additional code could be added to make sure that the same number
                            of cups are present before and after the reracking. Altogether, the robot functions as we had planned and was accurately able to clear multiple cups during testing and demostration periods. </p>
